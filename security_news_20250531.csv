U.S. DoJ Seizes 4 Domains Supporting Cybercrime Crypting Services in Global Operation,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/us-doj-seizes-4-domains-supporting.html,"A multinational law enforcement operation has resulted in the takedown of an online cybercrime syndicate that offered services to threat actors to ensure that their malicious software stayed undetected from security software.  To that effect, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said it seized four domains and their associated server facilitated the crypting service on May 27, 2025, in partnership with Dutch and Finnish authorities. These include AvCheck[.]net, Cryptor[.]biz, and Crypt[.]guru, all of which now display a seizure notice.  Other countries that participated in the effort include France, Germany, Denmark, Portugal, and Ukraine.  ""Crypting is the process of using software to make malware difficult for antivirus programs to detect,"" the DoJ said . ""The seized domains offered services to cybercriminals, including counter-antivirus (CAV) tools. When used together, CAV and crypting services allow criminals to obfuscate malware, making it undetectable and enabling...","May 31, 2025

New EDDIESTEALER Malware Bypasses Chrome's App-Bound Encryption to Steal Browser Data,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/eddiestealer-malware-uses-clickfix.html,"A new malware campaign is distributing a novel Rust-based information stealer dubbed EDDIESTEALER using the popular ClickFix  social engineering tactic initiated via fake CAPTCHA verification pages.  ""This campaign leverages deceptive CAPTCHA verification pages that trick users into executing a malicious PowerShell script, which ultimately deploys the infostealer, harvesting sensitive data such as credentials, browser information, and cryptocurrency wallet details,"" Elastic Security Labs researcher Jia Yu Chan said  in an analysis.  The attack chains begin with threat actors compromising legitimate websites with malicious JavaScript payloads that serve bogus CAPTCHA check pages, which prompt site visitors to ""prove you are not [a] robot"" by following a three-step process, a prevalent tactic called ClickFix .  This involves instructing the potential victim to open the Windows Run dialog prompt, paste an already copied command into the ""verification window""...","May 30, 2025

China-Linked Hackers Exploit SAP and SQL Server Flaws in Attacks Across Asia and Brazil,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/china-linked-hackers-exploit-sap-and.html,"The China-linked threat actor behind the recent in-the-wild exploitation of a critical security flaw in SAP NetWeaver has been attributed to a broader set of attacks targeting organizations in Brazil, India, and Southeast Asia since 2023.  ""The threat actor mainly targets the SQL injection vulnerabilities discovered on web applications to access the SQL servers of targeted organizations,"" Trend Micro security researcher Joseph C Chen said  in an analysis published this week. ""The actor also takes advantage of various known vulnerabilities to exploit public-facing servers.""  Some of the other prominent targets of the adversarial collective include Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.

"From the ""Department of No"" to a ""Culture of Yes"": A Healthcare CISO's Journey to Enabling Modern Care",https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/from-department-of-no-to-culture-of-yes.html,"Breaking Out of the Security Mosh Pit  When Jason Elrod, CISO of MultiCare Health System, describes legacy healthcare IT environments, he doesn't mince words: ""Healthcare loves to walk backwards into the future. And this is how we got here, because there are a lot of things that we could have prepared for that we didn't, because we were so concentrated on where we were.""  This chaotic approach has characterized healthcare IT for decades. In a sector where lives depend on technology working flawlessly 24/7/365, security teams have traditionally functioned as gatekeepers—the ""Department of No""—focused on protection at the expense of innovation and care delivery.  But as healthcare continues its digital transformation journey, this approach is no longer sustainable. With 14 hospitals, hundreds of urgent care clinics, and nearly 30,000 employees serving millions of patients, MultiCare needed a different path forward – one that didn't sacrifice innovation for safety.

U.S. Sanctions Funnull for $200M Romance Baiting Scams Tied to Crypto Fraud,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/us-sanctions-funnull-for-200m-romance.html,"The U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has levied sanctions against a Philippines-based company named Funnull Technology Inc. and its administrator Liu Lizhi for providing infrastructure to conduct romance baiting scams  that led to massive cryptocurrency losses.  The Treasury accused the Taguig-headquartered company of enabling thousands of websites involved in virtual currency investment scams that caused Americans to lose billions of dollars annually.  ""Funnull has directly facilitated several of these schemes, resulting in over $200 million in U.S. victim-reported losses,"" the agency said  in a press release.
